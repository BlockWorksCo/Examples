<h1>Miniweb - TCP/IP stack and webserver in less than 30 bytes</h1>
</td></tr></table>

<p align="justify">
Miniweb is a very tiny implementation of the TCP/IP protocol stack
together with a webserver written by Adam Dunkels. The TCP/IP stack
and the webserver uses around 30 bytes of RAM. The code is written in
C and constitutes around 400 lines, comments removed. It should be
possible to further minimize the code size and memory
usage. <b>Note:</b> this code is <b>not</b> intended for actual use,
it is only meant for educational purposes!
</p>


<h2>Miniweb</h2>
<p align="justify">
In order to reduce RAM usage, Miniweb stores its web pages as
precomputed IP/TCP packets complete with headers. When sending the
packets, only a few fields are updated and the checksums
adjusted. Incoming packets are processed one byte at a time and
therefore there is no need to buffer the data. The checksum is
computed when each byte is received and if the checksum is found to be
incorrect when the entire packet has been received, the contents of
the packet is not used for further processing.
</p>

<p align="justify">
There are two variants of Miniweb, a stateless variant and a statefull
variant. The stateless variant is a bit smaller and uses less RAM, but
does not provide the same functionality as the statefull
variant.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Both variants can handle multiple pages, <a
href="http://192.168.0.2:81/another_page.html">this</a> is another
page. 
</p>

<h3>The stateless Miniweb</h3>
<p align="justify">
The stateless Miniweb keeps only minimal state information. Instead of
keeping connection state, the stateless Miniweb uses the
acknowledgement numbers of the incomming ACKs to decide which TCP
segment to send. The IP address, port number and TCP sequence number
of the last received ACK is also saved so that if an ACK is lost, the
corresponding segment can be retransmitted. This means that if an ACK
in another "connection" arrives before the retransmission occurs, the
state of the previous connection is lost, and the retransmission will
never occur. This connection will hang until the application in the
other end sends data.
</p>
<p align="justify">
<b>It it important to note</b> that this approach of course is
<b>totally and utterly wrong</b>; a system using this approach should
<b>not</b> be connected to an actual network, let alone the global
Internet!
</p>

<p align="justify">
To make matters worse:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Miniweb does not support multiple TCP connections
<li>There is no support for dynamic content
</ul>

<h3>The stateful Miniweb</h3>

The stateful variant of Miniweb is activated by a compile time option
(-DSTATEFUL) and uses 5-7 bytes of extra RAM. This variant actually
keeps connection state and might therefore be considered to be a more
"real" TCP/IP implementation. It also does congestion control, making
it even more "real".

<h4>Congestion control</h4>
The stateful version of miniweb features a very minimal congestion
control mechanism; it implements the slow start algorithm. The
rationale behind this is that a webserver of this magnitude will most
likely only serve small files and images, and for such small transfers
the congestion avoidance phase is never entered anyway. 

<h2>Testing Miniweb</h2>
<p align="justify">
If you have a FreeBSD box you can test Miniweb directly. Linux users
need to download the <a
href="http://vtun.sourceforge.net/tun/">universal tun/tap</a> network
interface and compile it into their kernel.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Download <a
href="http://dunkels.com/adam/download/?f=miniweb.tar.gz">the code</a>
and do: 
<pre>
gunzip -c miniweb.tar.gz | tar xvf -
cd miniweb
gmake
su
./miniweb
</pre>
</p>
<p align="justify">
Now you should have the Miniweb TCP/IP stack and web server running on
IP address <a href="http://192.168.0.2/">192.168.0.2</a>. You can try
it out by clicking on the link. Note that it isn't possible to use
<b>ping</b> to reach the TCP/IP stack.
</p>
<p align="justify">
To inspect the packets that are sent to and from Miniweb, run
<pre>
tcpdump -l -n -S -i tun0
</pre>
